# Hi 👋 My name is Florian HALM

## Low-level enthusiast
I'm a developer passionate about low-level who enjoys exploring the lower layers of his machine to understand how it works. <br>
I'm particularly interested in C system programming and the inner workings of UNIX operating system kernels (with the ultimate goal of writing my own x86-32 toy kernel one day). <br>
I'm also intrigued by embedded systems, networking and cybersecurity.

Outside of low-level programming, I am also drawn to the development of game engines whether 2D (SDL2/C++), and especially 3D (OpenGL/C++) with the goal of creating a 3D renderer inspired by the PS1 graphics.

I am currently building a visual novel game engine ([EaZy Visual Novel engine](https://github.com/floDKDO/EZVN)) that aims to be more intuitive and efficient than the most widely used visual novel engine, that is Ren'Py.
